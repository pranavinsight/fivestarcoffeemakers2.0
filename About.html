    <p>Coffee’s Origins and Popularity Coffee is a beloved beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of the Coffea plant. Originating in Yemen in the 15th century, coffee has a rich history and has become one of the most popular drinks worldwide. It’s known for its distinctive, somewhat bitter flavor and its ability to stimulate the human body due to its caffeine content. Today, coffee stands as the world’s top-selling hot drink</p>
    <p>Types of Coffee Beans The two primary types of coffee beans are Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta. Arabica beans are known for their milder, more flavorful, and aromatic brew, while Robusta beans are more robust and have a higher caffeine content. Arabica beans are more widespread but require specific growing conditions, including higher elevations and a cool subtropical climate. Robusta, on the other hand, can grow at lower altitudes and is typically used in commercial coffee brands</p>
    <p>Cultivation and Environmental Impact Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in equatorial regions such as the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. Brazil is the leading grower of coffee beans, contributing to 35% of the world’s production. However, the coffee industry faces criticism for its environmental impact, including land clearing and water use, and the economic challenges faced by coffee farmers</p>
    <p>Preparation and Consumption Coffee can be prepared and presented in various ways, from a simple black coffee to more complex drinks like espresso, French press, caffè latte, or canned coffee. Additives like sugar, milk, and cream are often used to enhance its flavor. Despite its global commodity status, coffee remains closely tied to local food traditions and cultural practices</p>
    <p>Economic Significance The global coffee industry is massive, valued at $495.50 billion as of 2023. The top exporters of coffee beans include Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia. While coffee sales reach billions of dollars, it’s important to note that many coffee bean farmers live in poverty, highlighting the need for sustainable and equitable trade practices in the coffee industry</p>
